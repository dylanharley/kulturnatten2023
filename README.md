*TODO*

_Essentials:_
- Make "CircuitSlot" class to distinguish bits where the gates can go
- Have some "gameState" variable in the app which tracks the state of the game, (i.e. pick slot / pick gate / ready / running / results) to control behaviour of items in different situations
- New p5 canvas to display coin flipping animation
- Make cursor to display current phase of the game
- Digital "cloth" to cover the move of the adversary
- Some few text boxes (?)
- Popup for displaying results

_Cosmetics:_
- Clicking animations / transitions
- Display SVG for measurement
- Display SVG as button?
