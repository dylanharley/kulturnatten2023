_Done:_

- Have some "gameState" variable in the app which tracks the state of the game, (i.e. pick slot / pick gate / ready / running / results) to control behaviour of items in different situations
- New p5 canvas to display coin flipping animation
- Make cursor to display current phase of the game
- Some few text boxes (?)
- Popup for displaying results
